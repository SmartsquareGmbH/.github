_Crafting Code since 2011_

### Hello and welcome! :wave:

Smartsquare from Bielefeld designs and develops customised software solutions on behalf of customers.
We bring IoT business solutions, web applications and apps from the initial idea to successful deployment.

### Open Source

Smartsquare is active in the open-source community. 
Our projects aren't just lines of code; they are born from real-world challenges and solutions. 
Grounded in practical experiences, these open-source initiatives reflect our commitment to transparency, collaboration, and innovation.
Feel free to leverage them in your own projects.
We're glad about feedback, whether it is bug reports or ideas.
